# Discrete State Pattern
A pattern for creating highly compact and light-weight general purpose finite state machines.

## Two Flavors
Two example implementations of the pattern have been included. <i>Basic</i> and <i>Minimal</i>.
Please do not use the minimal implementation in a production environment, it is meant to be a
clever example.

## Design
Simplicity is key. The state machine is comprised of two components. A state machine manager and
the states. The state machine manager can be thought of as a scheduler, it recieves requests
made by the states and processes said requests. The requests made by the states are transitions,
which can either be to the same state (effectively restarting it), or to a new state. States never
interact with each other directly, and it is the job of the state machine manager to enfore this
seperation.

## Four Principles
The pattern consists of four principles, and it is important that you follow them when
implementing this pattern.

#### 1. States are responsible for deciding the next transition.
The state machine manager should never be responsible for deciding which state it should
transition to. This removes the need for switches and enumerations. The only added exception
is mentioned in principle #3.

#### 2. State machine manager is responsible for making transitions.
States themselves should never be allowed to make transitions directly. Instead, states are
to request which states they would like the state machine manager to transition to by returning
a pointer to said state. This ensures that control is always transferred back to the state machine
manager, thus for, relieving pressure on the call stack.

#### 3. State machine manager is responsible for state machine shutdown.
States themselves should never be allowed to shutdown the state machine. If there is no state
for a state to transition to then that state should relay that to the state machine manager.
The state machine manager will then be responsible for deciding if the state machine should
shutdown, restart, or transition to a fallback/error state.

#### 4. Discreteness
The internals of the state machine manager should never be exposed nor should the state machine
manager store states outside of its scope. The state machine manager should operate as a sealed
unit. However, the state machine manager may utilize global data to determine a valid fallback/error
state or if the state machine should be shutdown. States are also free to utilize global data as
well.

Adhering to these principles will ensure high scalability and maintainability across all of
your models. Additionally, with some ingenuity, this pattern can also be used for deep
recursion and will never flood the call stack.
